Assignment 3
For this assignment, I chose to clone FiveThirtyEight's data repository, looking specifically at data/bechdel. This contains the data/code for a story they did about the relationship between the Bechdel test and box office numbers.
They got a list of movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test from bechdeltest.com and box office info at the-numbers.com to over 1600 movies and their relationship between passing the test and budgets and profits.
It includes year of release, result of the test, and money info like budget and gross profit.
This is a really interesting topic. The Bechdel test really has a low bar for passing, and still almost half of the movies didn't. It was interesting to go through their analysis of how that relates to what Hollywood is really about: $$$.
It's helpful in data/bechdel/analyze-bechdel.R that they describe the purpose of each command, because by the url, I assume they did this with R, so I didn't recognize the commands.
